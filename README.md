# Web-Design-Challenge
Creation of the HW 11 repo. 
The purpose of this project is to create a web page with multiple landing pages that displays the analysis conducted in order to determine weather behavior as one approaches the equator.  

The data for this analysis was gathered in a previous project. In the previous project, analysis was conducted to show how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidty. This site provides the source data and visualtizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
